                            Kohli started his career in Delhi and quickly rose through the ranks, making his ODI debut
                            in 2008. He quickly established himself in the Indian middle-order and was a crucial part of
                            the victorious 2011 World Cup squad. By 2013, he had shed the "ODI specialist" label by
                            scoring Test centuries and had become a star in T20 cricket as well. He served as captain of
                            the Indian team across all formats for several years, leading India to success before
                            stepping down to focus on his batting.
